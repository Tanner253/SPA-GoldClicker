                <h2>Purpose of $CMINER</h2>
                <p>$CMINER is a prototype development token designed to support and test the core systems of our play-to-earn game prior to the launch of our main token, $GCM. While $CMINER is not the final product, it plays a critical role in ensuring the stability, balance, and economic integrity of the game ecosystem.</p>
                
                <h3>Short-Term Utility, Long-Term Value</h3>
                <p>The $CMINER chart serves as an essential short-term testing environment to validate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Game functionality</li>
                    <li>Economic distribution mechanics</li>
                    <li>Real-time feedback on valuation and reward pacing</li>
                    <li>On-chain integration and analytics tracking</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This real-world simulation allows us to refine formulas, calibrate rewards, and stress test monetization loops before $GCM's full deployment.</p>
                <p>Importantly, $CMINER will not be abandoned. While its primary utility is short-term, it will receive long-term support post-launch as part of our broader ecosystem. However, we do not have a specific ETA for long-term support (LTS) at this time.</p>
                
                <h3>Why This Approach Matters</h3>
                <p>Building sustainable, on-chain economies is hard. Many play-to-earn games fail due to unsound reward logic or unchecked inflation. By launching $CMINER as a pre-production utility token, we de-risk the mainnet launch of $GCM and deliver a more polished, fair, and scalable ecosystem to players and investors alike.</p>
                
                <h3>Vision for GCM</h3>
                <p>GCM (Gold Clicker Mining) is more than a token — it's a brand and future enterprise. GCM will serve as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The central currency ("mother coin") of the entire game platform</li>
                    <li>The main hub from which users access multiple connected arcade-style games</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When players open the GCM app, they'll enter a universe of mini-games — from a Temple Run-style endless runner to roguelikes like Brotato, PvP tank battlers, and more. Each game will have its own reward logic and memecoin chart.</p>
                
                <h3>Ecosystem Structure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$GCM:</strong> The main token and app ecosystem hub</li>
                    <li><strong>Mini-games:</strong> Each with their own economy and play-to-earn model</li>
                    <li><strong>$CMINER:</strong> The first experimental chart and the first to be revived post-GCM launch</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>
