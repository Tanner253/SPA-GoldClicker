**Welcome to Gold Clicker Mining ($GCM)! This site serves as a whitepaper and an interactive demonstration of our addictive free-to-play clicker game where you can earn real crypto rewards.**

Dive into a unique player-centric Play-to-Earn (P2E) model designed to be fun and rewarding. Invest in the future of memecoin gaming and make money while you play!

## ‚ú® High-Level Concept

Gold Clicker Mining ($GCM) is a web-based clicker game where players engage in simulated mining activities. The core gameplay loop involves:

1.  **Clicking:** Players click on designated areas (e.g., a gold vein, a mine shaft) to generate in-game resources.
2.  **Upgrading:** Accumulated resources can be used to purchase upgrades that increase clicking power, automate resource generation, or unlock new game features.
3.  **Earning $GCM:** Through gameplay, achievements, and potentially other in-game mechanics, players earn $GCM tokens ‚Äì our native cryptocurrency.
4.  **Blockchain Integration:** (Details to be expanded in a full whitepaper) $GCM tokens are envisioned to be blockchain-based, allowing for true ownership, trading, and potential staking or other DeFi activities.

This project aims to blend the engaging and accessible nature of clicker/idle games with the exciting possibilities of cryptocurrency and the Play-to-Earn model.

## üìú Whitepaper Insights (From this Website)

This website itself acts as an initial whitepaper, providing a glimpse into the core ideas of Gold Clicker Mining:

*   **Free-to-Play & Accessible:** Anyone can start playing and earning without an upfront investment.
*   **Player-Centric P2E:** Our model focuses on rewarding active gameplay and strategic decisions.
*   **Crypto Rewards:** Earn tangible value in the form of $GCM tokens.
*   **Memecoin Gaming Future:** We believe in the potential of combining meme culture with engaging gaming experiences and real economic incentives.
*   **Community Driven:** (To be elaborated) Future plans may include community governance, player-influenced development, and social features.
*   **$CMINER Token:** Learn about our prototype development token and its role in the ecosystem.

A more detailed and formal whitepaper will be developed to cover tokenomics, roadmap, technical architecture, and governance in greater depth.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (e.g., v16 or later)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tanner253/SPA-GoldClicker.git
    cd SPA-GoldClicker
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm test` / `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
*   `npm run build` / `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
*   `npm run eject` / `yarn eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## üí° Future Ideas (To be expanded in full Whitepaper)

*   Detailed Tokenomics for $GCM (Supply, Distribution, Utility)
*   NFT Integration (e.g., for special mining tools, land, characters)
*   Staking $GCM for rewards
*   Marketplace for in-game items or NFTs
*   Leaderboards and Competitive Events
*   Advanced Social Features
*   Mobile versions
